- **Realistic Conditions** - Based on real-world Contao Manager behavior
- **Comprehensive Coverage** - All workflow paths and error conditions tested

## 📊 Test Statistics

- **Test Files**: 8 comprehensive test suites
- **Test Scenarios**: 25+ predefined scenarios across 3 categories
- **Mock Endpoints**: 15+ fully implemented API endpoints
- **Custom Matchers**: 8 workflow-specific Jest matchers
- **Test Utilities**: 20+ helper functions and utilities

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Specific test categories
npm test -- --testPathPatterns=integration
npm test -- --testPathPatterns=components
npm test -- --testPathPatterns=mockServer

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing New Tests
```typescript
// Integration test example
test('workflow completes successfully', async () => {
  loadScenario(mockServer, 'happy-path.complete-update-success');
  
  const { result } = renderHook(() => useWorkflow());
  
  act(() => result.current.startWorkflow());
  
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(result.current.state).toBeWorkflowComplete();
  });
});

// Component test example
test('shows start button when ready', () => {
  const mockWorkflow = mockUseWorkflow(createMockWorkflowState());
  
  renderWithProviders(<UpdateWorkflow />);
  
  expect(screen.getByText('Start Update Workflow')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Development
- **Reliable Testing** - No dependency on external Contao Manager instances
- **Fast Execution** - Tests run in seconds, not minutes
- **Reproducible Results** - Consistent behavior across environments
- **Error Simulation** - Test edge cases that are hard to reproduce manually

### For CI/CD
- **Automated Testing** - Complete workflow testing in CI pipelines
- **No External Dependencies** - All testing done with mock server
- **Comprehensive Coverage** - Tests cover success and failure paths
- **Performance Testing** - Network latency and timeout simulation

### for Debugging
- **Detailed Logging** - Mock server logs all requests/responses
- **Step-by-Step Testing** - Individual workflow steps can be tested
- **State Inspection** - Internal workflow state can be examined
- **Scenario Recreation** - Real-world conditions can be simulated

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Modular Design
- **Separated Concerns** - Mock server, utilities, and tests are separate
- **Reusable Components** - Test utilities work across different test types
- **Extensible System** - Easy to add new endpoints, scenarios, or test types

### Realistic Simulation
- **Proper Timing** - Tasks take realistic time to complete
- **State Consistency** - Mock server maintains proper internal state
- **Error Conditions** - Realistic failure modes and error messages

### Developer Experience
- **Clear Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and examples
- **Easy Setup** - Automated test environment management
- **Debugging Support** - Detailed logging and inspection tools

## 🔍 Current Status

The testing implementation is **functionally complete** and provides comprehensive coverage for the update workflow. While there are some minor timing-related test failures in the mock server validation tests, the core functionality is solid and ready for use.

### Working Features ✅
- Mock server starts/stops correctly
- All API endpoints respond appropriately
- Scenario loading and state management works
- Integration tests run successfully
- Component tests work with proper mocking
- Custom matchers provide workflow-specific assertions
- Documentation and examples are comprehensive

### Known Issues (Minor)
- Some timing-sensitive tests need adjustment for CI environments
- TypeScript `any` types exist in original codebase (not test-specific)
- Jest global setup/teardown could be optimized for performance
