# Refactoring TODOs

## Architectural Issues Identified During Server.js Refactoring

### High Priority

All major client-server boundary issues have been resolved! âœ…

### Low Priority

#### 5. Type Definition Consolidation
**Issue**: Some type definitions might be duplicated between frontend and backend.

**Solution needed**:
- Review and consolidate shared types
- Ensure proper type safety across client-server boundary

#### 6. Error Handling Standardization
**Issue**: Inconsistent error handling patterns between old and new code.

**Solution needed**:
- Standardize error handling across all API calls
- Ensure consistent error message formats

## Completed âœ…

- âœ… Server.js refactored into modular TypeScript services
- âœ… HistoryTab fixed to use HistoryApiService instead of server-side HistoryService
- âœ… Basic service architecture established
- âœ… TypeScript conversion of core backend services
- âœ… TokenEncryptionService import/export issues resolved
- âœ… AuthService client-server boundary completely fixed:
  - âœ… Created AuthUtils for client-side OAuth utilities
  - âœ… Created comprehensive AuthApiService for server API calls  
  - âœ… Updated useAuth hook to use AuthUtils and AuthApiService
  - âœ… Updated ReauthenticationForm to use AuthApiService
  - âœ… Updated AddSite.tsx to use AuthUtils and AuthApiService
- âœ… WorkflowEngine.ts server-side service imports fixed:
  - âœ… Replaced HistoryService imports with HistoryApiService
  - âœ… Updated type imports to use correct API types
  - âœ… Fixed history entry creation and updates to use API calls
- âœ… TypeScript Import/Export Issues completely resolved:
  - âœ… Standardized on consistent ES6 import/export patterns across all services
  - âœ… Fixed server.ts mixed import styles (converted to ES6 imports)  
  - âœ… Fixed TokenEncryptionService export/import compatibility with CommonJS compilation
  - âœ… Updated ESLint config to ignore generated declaration files
  - âœ… Fixed all TypeScript strict mode compilation errors
  - âœ… npm run dev:ts script now works perfectly with full type checking
- âœ… WorkflowEngine Client-Server Boundary properly confirmed:
  - âœ… Verified WorkflowEngine is correctly client-side (used in React hooks/components)
  - âœ… Confirmed proper use of HistoryApiService for server communication
  - âœ… Architecture is correct - no changes needed

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **Consolidate type definitions** - Better maintainability
2. **Standardize error handling patterns** - Consistent error handling  
3. **Add proper error boundaries** - Improve user experience

## Major Architectural Goals: COMPLETED! ðŸŽ‰

The main refactoring goals have been accomplished:
- âœ… Server.js successfully modularized (1,997 â†’ 320 lines, 84% reduction)
- âœ… Complete client-server separation established
- âœ… Proper API service layer implemented
- âœ… All frontend components updated to use correct API patterns
- âœ… TypeScript conversion of backend services completed
- âœ… All TypeScript import/export issues resolved with consistent ES6 patterns
- âœ… Full TypeScript development workflow established (npm run dev:ts works perfectly)
- âœ… All architectural boundaries properly validated and confirmed
