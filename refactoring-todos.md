# Refactoring TODOs

## Architectural Issues Identified During Server.js Refactoring

### High Priority

All major client-server boundary issues have been resolved! âœ…

### Medium Priority

#### 3. TypeScript Import/Export Issues
**Issue**: Mixed ES6 modules and CommonJS causing compilation issues in some contexts.

**Files affected:**
- Various service imports need consistent module patterns
- Server.ts has mixed import styles

**Solution needed**:
- Standardize on consistent import/export patterns
- Fix remaining TypeScript compilation warnings

#### 4. WorkflowEngine Client-Server Boundary
**Issue**: WorkflowEngine appears to be client-side but imports server-side services.

**Solution needed**:
- Determine if WorkflowEngine should be server-side or client-side
- If client-side, convert to use API calls
- If server-side, move to appropriate location

### Low Priority

#### 5. Type Definition Consolidation
**Issue**: Some type definitions might be duplicated between frontend and backend.

**Solution needed**:
- Review and consolidate shared types
- Ensure proper type safety across client-server boundary

#### 6. Error Handling Standardization
**Issue**: Inconsistent error handling patterns between old and new code.

**Solution needed**:
- Standardize error handling across all API calls
- Ensure consistent error message formats

## Completed âœ…

- âœ… Server.js refactored into modular TypeScript services
- âœ… HistoryTab fixed to use HistoryApiService instead of server-side HistoryService
- âœ… Basic service architecture established
- âœ… TypeScript conversion of core backend services
- âœ… TokenEncryptionService import/export issues resolved
- âœ… AuthService client-server boundary completely fixed:
  - âœ… Created AuthUtils for client-side OAuth utilities
  - âœ… Created comprehensive AuthApiService for server API calls  
  - âœ… Updated useAuth hook to use AuthUtils and AuthApiService
  - âœ… Updated ReauthenticationForm to use AuthApiService
  - âœ… Updated AddSite.tsx to use AuthUtils and AuthApiService
- âœ… WorkflowEngine.ts server-side service imports fixed:
  - âœ… Replaced HistoryService imports with HistoryApiService
  - âœ… Updated type imports to use correct API types
  - âœ… Fixed history entry creation and updates to use API calls

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **Consolidate type definitions** - Better maintainability
2. **Standardize error handling patterns** - Consistent error handling  
3. **Add proper error boundaries** - Improve user experience
4. **Fix remaining TypeScript/ESLint warnings** - Code quality improvements
