## Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard provides a centralized view of all your Contao Manager instances. Each site is displayed as a card showing:

- **Site name** and URL
- **Current status** (online, updating, error)
- **Last activity** timestamp
- **Quick access buttons** for common operations
- **Permission scope** indicator

### Navigation Elements

- **Add New Site** - Add additional Contao Manager instances
- **Site Cards** - Click any site card to access detailed management
- **Theme Toggle** - Switch between light and dark modes
- **Settings Menu** - Access global application settings

## Adding Sites

### Step 1: Site Information

1. Click **"Add New Site"** from the dashboard
2. Enter the full **Contao Manager URL**:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/contao-manager.phar.php
   ```
3. Provide a **display name** (optional - will auto-generate from URL)

### Step 2: Permission Scope

Select the appropriate permission level for this site:

**Read**
: View site information, status, and logs. No modification capabilities.

**Update**
: Read permissions plus composer updates and Contao Manager self-updates.

**Install**
: Update permissions plus package installation, removal, and configuration changes.

**Admin**

{: .highlight }
**Tip**: Start with the minimum scope needed. You can always re-authenticate with higher permissions later.

### Step 3: Authentication Flow

The application will redirect you to your Contao Manager for secure OAuth authentication:

1. **Login** with your Contao Manager credentials
2. **Two-Factor Authentication** - Enter TOTP code if enabled
3. **Authorize Application** - Grant the requested permissions
4. **Automatic Redirect** - Return to API Browser with active token
